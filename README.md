## Notes
The "Coordinates.csv" file is actively used in generate_map.py to find the geomagnetic vectors for the different 
positions in the grid, however "Coordinates.nmea" is a generated file from the website "https://nmeagen.org/#". This is 
the website that was used to find the coordinates in longitude and latitude, that were all spaced 3 miles apart, to 
accurately reflect a real area. Through this website you can load the .nmea file and see the positions marked, and even 
change it if desired.
